See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Bitcoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.5 and 10.6 intel.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked. Don't forget to launch Xcode before continue.


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

2.  Download and install Home Brew

3.  Install dependencies from Brew

brew install boost berkeley-db4 openssl miniupnpc

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
brew install qrencode

4.  Now you should be able to build cryptobulliond:

cd CryptoBullion-CBX/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./cryptobulliond --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./cryptobulliond -daemon # to start the bitcoin daemon.
Run
  ./cryptobulliond help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
