Released in late June 2013, CGB was designed primarily for the purpose of storing wealth. Cryptogenic Bullion is a second generation crypto-currency designed to emulate the properties and supply of gold. Itâ€™s the first crypto-currency to display all of the properties of money, while providing the bearer with interest for holding it.
Unlike most other crypto-currencies, Cryptogenic Bullion has already completed its volatile monetary base expansion stage and is settling in to its maximum target of 2% expansion per year.

To qualify for interest, an investor must keep their funds unspent in their wallets for a minimum of 30 days (for 1.2% interest), and up to a maximum of 90 days (1.5% interest).

With the baseline mining reward expected to be reached within 1 year of release, and the annual inflation target of 2% fast approaching, there is no better time for the serious investor to get involved and claim a stake in this unique digital asset.

New feature developments currently being assembled for client 2.0 release include but are not limited to:

- Balance POS/POW block creation - POS time changes, POW time changes

- Add stake visualization

- Add unlock button to easily unlock wallet for staking

- Client styling

- Fully implement multisig, and make sure getrawtransaction PRC call is available - to support distributed exchange

- Add coin control

- Improve client start up time

- Merged mining

- Stealth addresses
