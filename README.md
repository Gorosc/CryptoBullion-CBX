Linear Difficulty Retarget (2 block retarget)

Block reward halves after every ~50000 blocks:

Blocks 1-55000 = 10 CGB per; 
Blocks 55001-95000 = 5 CGB per;
Blocks 95001-145000 = 2.5 CGB per;
Blocks 145001-195000 = 1.25 CGB per
etc

First year coin mint of ~1000000

Aiming to be PoS-only blockchain once PoW block subsidy reaches baseline reward of 0.01.
Much research will go into maintaining security of the blockchain if/when CGB goes PoS only.  Many possible schemes and solutions are being analyzed for potential implementation, including but not limited to:

-CoinJoin revision for additional PoS overlay scheme

-Increasing PoS rewards to slightly accelerate coin cap growth, to make it more difficult for 51% stake attack.

-Revision to current PoS trust score algorithm

-Additional randomized trust score scheme to increase scrutiny for randomly selected new PoS blocks
